SCOMERGER
=========

`scomerger` is a seiscomp3 application which aims to merge origins belonging to the same event and from 2 differents authors (*primary* and *secondary*). A new origin is created with arrivals from both origins and then a relocation (LocSAT) is done.

`scomerger` works like this:

- it listens to `EVENT` messages from `scevent`,
- when receiving a `EVENT` message :

	- if the preferred origin is already a merged origin, `scomerger` send a message to scevent 
	  to remove this merged origin. `scevent` selects then a new prefered origin and sends
	  a new `EVENT` message (which will be received by `scomerger`).
	- if the preferred origin is from the *primary* author, `scomerger` merges the origin from
  	  the *primary* author with the *secondary* one. A new origin is created with the arrivals of
     both origins and relocated with `LOCSAT` (magnitude is not yet updated for the moment). 
   - `scomerger` send the new origin message and lets `scevent` associated it to the corresponding 	  event and select the new prefered origin.

`scomerger` was designed to work separately from the mainstream (use a dedicated pipeline) to avoid nested
messages. `scomerger` indeed listen `EVENT` messaging group but also send
messages to it.

Installation
------------

1. Copy the different files into seiscomp3 folders:

    ```bash
    cp descriptions/scomerger.xml /path/to/seiscomp3/etc/descriptions/
cp init/scomerger.py /path/to/seiscomp3/etc/init/
cp scomerger /path/to/seiscomp3/bin/
    ```

2. Configure `scomerger`

3. Activate the seiscomp3 module:

    ```bash
    seiscomp enable scomerger
seiscomp start scomerger
    ```

Useful options
--------------

`scomerger` can be run on a particular event with the `-E` or `--event` option:

```bash
seiscomp exec scomerger -E eost2016ehix
```

It can be run on a period of time as well:

```bash
seiscomp exec scomerger --begin 2016-03-01T00:00:00.0 --end 2016-03-08T00:00:00.0
```

It is also possible to remove the merged origins with the `-R` option:

```bash
seiscomp exec scomerger -E eost2016ehix -R
```
